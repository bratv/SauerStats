# SauerStats
An desktop app to follow player and server stats of the game called Sauerbraten.

This is a java project of mine where I use an udp connection to a Sauerbraten game server. You send a certain message to the server to get certain data back from it.
The app shows this data to the user in the form of a JTable, where each column is supposed to sort the data acordingly to what the user is interested in.
For instance, if user wants to see who has most frags at a given moment, he should be able to press the "frags" column of the JTable and it should sort players in ascending or descending order of frags made.
